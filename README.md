# URP
Script to calculate Boolean Complement using Unate Recursive Paradigm (URP)

This is a Python script utilizing the Unate Recursive Paradigm to find the complement of Boolean Expressions in SOP form represented as a PCN (Positional Cube Notation) cube list. It implements the Shannon Co-factoring method to split the Boolean function into positive and negative co-factors, enabling the computation of the complement of the Boolean function from the complement of the individual co-factors. 

The recursive algorithm is used to perform the splitting process until the cube list is simplified, allowing for direct complementation. This script replicates the steps used in a typical VLSI CAD software tool at a minimal and novice level.
